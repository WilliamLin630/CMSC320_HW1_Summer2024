I am mainly interested in CMSC320 to help me develop better analytical skills that I have never used before. There is so much analysis going on whether it is that I am collecting data, exploring, building models, and etc. These skills are valuable no matter what field of Computer Science and Math I go into and so I believe this class is interesting in this way.
